# MLSAC
Project name: MLSAC.

Description: MLSAC project stands for "Migration of Legacy Software Applications to the Cloud", a generic and customizable environment to design and maintain situation-specific methods for moving legacy software applications to cloud platforms. The user/audience of this environment is method engineers who are responsible to design and maintain reengineering methods/strategies specific to cloud migration. 

Importance: various reengineering methods to make software applications cloud-enabled are often limited to a particular cloud platform and, in many cases, describe a disparate point of view to the reengineering process. There is a conceptual link between these different methods as they show the same process but from a different perspective. Such links have not yet been sufficiently explored to provide a complete vision of the legacy to cloud reengineering processes. This paucity of exploration offers a compelling opportunity for more efficient modelling, maintenance, and better sharing of bespoke reengineering methods and experiences amongst developers. 

Goal: To address this gap, we introduce a novel MLSAC framework, underpinning by a metamodeling approach. MLSAC framework has a metamodel integrating all recurring cloud reengineering process method fragments and a tailoring procedure to customize the metamodel according to a given migration context.

The contributions of this project are fourfold:
i) MLSAC facilitates the understandability of the reengineering process for its audience (e.g., method engineers). It utilizes the power of domain-specific abstractions by comprising a collection of reusable method fragments (or building blocks) of reengineering methods. MLSAC distinguishes between method definition artefact and method enactment artefact. The former refers to designing necessary phases, activities, and techniques to conduct the reengineering process of legacy applications to make them cloud-enabled in line with the requirements of the reengineering scenarios. The latter refers to the execution of the designed method by a development team for coding and deploying the applications on cloud platforms. MLSAC reduces the complexity of a method design so that a method engineer can concentrate on the method design and improvement of its modularity rather than getting entangled with the intricacies of the underlying target cloud platforms.
ii) MLSAC provides a basis for method tailorability and creating situation-specific methods for reengineering scenarios.
iii) MLSAC is a metamodel based approach that facilitates the maintenance and consistent interchangeability of evolving methods that can be further reused in multiple reengineering scenarios.
iv) MLSAC constitutes a collection of validated and commonly grounded platform-independent meth-od fragments that can be incorporated and sequenced to run alongside conventional (reengineering) software process development to extend their capability for the reengineering to the cloud. A method engineer can use MLSAC as guidance/checklist to ensure that necessary steps are conducted in the transition to the cloud.

Installation: The technologies used for the implementation of the prototype are Microsoft .Net Framework 2015, C# programming language, and Microsoft Access Database. To edit the source code or execute the prototype system these technologies need to be installed. 

Usage: We have provided a case study scenario (file name Using MLSAC - Case study 1.pdf in the root directory) showing interactive forms of MLSAC prototype system to create and maintain a reengineering method. In the case of a need to get access source code and modify it, it is needed to unzip files "WindowsFormsApplication1.7z" and ".vs.7z" on the computer. 

License: MLSAC project is open source. Method engineers and software teams can download and improve MLSAC system.
